				<h1>The 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Advances in Fog/Edge Computing (AFEC 2022)</h1>
				<br>
				<h2>In conjunction with the 31th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN 2022)</h2>
				<h2>April 25 - 26, 2022, Jerusalem, Israel</h2>
				<br>

				<br>
					<h2>THE WORKSHOP SCOPE</h2>
						<p>  Recent rapid advances in Mobile Cellular Networks, Cloud Computing, and Big Data have introduced Fog/Edge Computing as an interesting topic to the research community. 
						Since its first appearance, the Fog/Edge Computing has received much attention from practitioners, scholars, and the general public. 
						Considering that we are in the era of big data, many applications, such as the Internet of Things, Mobile Social Networks, and Smart City, keep generating data and interacting with the remote data centers all the time, which creates unique requirements and new challenges on the computation, storage, and communication. 
						Thanks to the idea of the Fog/Edge Computing, tasks can be mitigated from the heavy-weighted data center to local devices, which not only reduces the workload of the data center but also accelerates the average serving speed. 
						Many new techniques have been developed and are adopted in the Fog/Edge Computing. 
						Due to the benefits of using Fog/Edge Computing, many emergent applications are now available for individuals, business enterprises, and governments. 
						To this end, this workshop aims to create a platform for scholars, industry professionals, and government officials to discuss and share new research ideas and technologies in the Edge/Fog Computing and related applications.</p>

					<h2>INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS</h2>
						<P>
						Submitted manuscripts must be formatted in standard IEEE camera-ready format (double-column, 10-pt font) and must be submitted via Easychair (https://easychair.org/account/signin) as PDF files (formatted for 8.5x11-inch paper). The manuscripts should be no longer than 6 pages. Two additional pages are permitted if the authors are willing to pay an over-length charge at the time of publication (manuscripts should not exceed 8 pages). Submitted papers cannot have been previously published in or be under consideration for publication in another journal or conference. The workshop Program Committee reserves the right to not review papers that either exceeds the length specification or have been submitted or published elsewhere. Submissions must include a title, abstract, keywords, author(s) and affiliation(s) with postal and e-mail address(es).

					<h2>REVIEW AND PUBLICATION OF MANUSCRIPTS</h2>
						<P>Submitted papers will be reviewed by the workshop Program Committee and judged on originality, technical correctness, relevance, and quality of presentation. 
						An accepted paper must be presented at the ICCCN 2022 venue by one of the authors registered at the full registration rate. 
						Each workshop registration covers up to two workshop papers by an author. 
						Accepted and presented papers will be published in the ICCCN proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore as well as other Abstracting and Indexing (A&amp;I) databases. 
						IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference, including IEEE Xplore® Digital Library if the paper <b>is not presented</b> by the author at the conference.</P>
